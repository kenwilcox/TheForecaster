# TheForecaster
A weather application with Apple WatchKit extension

In order to use this you will have to 

- Get your own API Keys from [https://developer.forecast.io/](https://developer.forecast.io/)
- Rename APIKeys.template.swift to APIKeys.swift
- Replace kAPIKey value received from developer.forecast.io

You should be good to go after that
